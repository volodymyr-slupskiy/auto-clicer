<b>main.py</b> - <i>simple clicker for mouse - to run it you need to run main.py in the terminal or in the pycharm, to enable / disable, press the Capslock key</i><br>
<b>imagecliker.py</b> - <i>it this is my attempt to write a clicker that searches for selected images on the screen and clicks on them.
